# Streaming ANN and AKDE
This repository contains codes of the proposed `ANN` and `AKDE` algorithms. The code is tested in Linux platform (python 3.11).

## Run the codes
The codes for AKDE are present in `Code/SlidingWindowKDE` whereas that of ANN are in `Code/StreamingANN`.

## AKDE
Change the current directory to `/Code/SlidingWindowKDE/'.

First of all you need to generate the daatsets. To generate synthetic data, run `data_generate.py`
